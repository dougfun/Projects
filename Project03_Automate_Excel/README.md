## Project 3 - Automate Excel
---
This project involves extracting data from PDF reports and transforming them into a single Excel file for analysis and organization. The project could involve developing a program that can read in multiple PDF reports, extract relevant data, and convert it into a usable format for Excel. This type of project can be particularly useful for organizations that receive data in PDF format from external partners or vendors and need to transform it into a format that can be used for analysis and decision-making.
