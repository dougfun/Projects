 ## Project 01 - Sales Analysis
---
In this project, a Python script is created to combine multiple Excel reports into a single file for easier data analysis and management. The project will involve writing a script that can read in multiple Excel reports, extract the necessary data, and then combine them into a single file. This will be particularly useful for businesses or organizations that have multiple teams or departments producing their own reports and need to combine the data for analysis and decision-making purposes.
